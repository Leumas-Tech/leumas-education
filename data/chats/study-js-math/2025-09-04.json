      "content": "It looks like you're close, but there's a small issue.\n\nIn your function `sum(arr)`, you're initializing the variable `total` with `let total;`. However, in JavaScript, when you initialize a variable without using the `let` or `const` keywords, it becomes a global variable. But in this case, we want `total` to be a local variable that's specific to our function.\n\nChange this line:\n\n```javascript\nlet total;\n```\n\nto:\n\n```javascript\nlet total = 0; // Initialize total with a value of 0\n```\n\nThis ensures that each time the function is called, `total` has its own starting value, which prevents any unexpected behavior due to global variables.\n\nHere's your corrected code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(arr) {\n    let total = 0; // Fix: Initialize total as a local variable\n    for (let num of arr) {\n        total += num;\n    }\n    if (total === 0) {\n        return 0;\n    } else {\n        return total;\n    }\n}\nconsole.log(sum([1,2,3])); // Outputs the correct sum: 6\n```\n\nTry this and see if it fixes the issue!",
